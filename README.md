# OPPS.NetCoreMvc

I developed a human resources project as a BilgeAdam graduation project. The project was developed using .Net Core, Mvc design pattern, Unit of work design pattern, repository pattern, auto mapper, boostrap, entity framework core. I created the database with the Code First approach using Microsoft Sql Server. Solid and OOP principles were used.
